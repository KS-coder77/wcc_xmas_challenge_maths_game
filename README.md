Welcome to my Christmas Coding Challenge 2024 repository! This challenge was organized by the Women Coding Community. Over the month of December I have dedicated time to learning and developing an end-to-end web application using react and javascript in the frontend and flask and python for the backend. It is still a work in progress as there are featues I intend to add and improve on in the new year. Thank you Women Coding Community for the motivation and inspiration to learn something new and to challenge myself.
